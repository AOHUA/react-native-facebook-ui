# react-native-facebook-ui
Pure javascript prototype of iOS Facebook UI for React Native framework. This only includes the newsfeed page--more to be updated in the future!
Feel free to contribute the Android version.


##Inspiration
I was inspired by an app I use everyday--Facebook! :-)

###Demo

## Try it out

Try it with Exponent: https://getexponent.com/@sungwoopark95/react-native-facebook-ui

## Run it locally

To install, there are two steps:

1. Install Exponent XDE [following this
guide](https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).
Also install the Exponent app on your phone if you want to test it on
your device, otherwise you don't need to do anything for the simulator.
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ggomaeng/react-native-facebook-ui.git facebook

  cd facebook
  npm install
  ```
3. Open the project with Exponent XDE and run it.
